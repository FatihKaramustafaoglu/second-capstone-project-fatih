<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Fatih Karamustafaoğlu. I was born in Kayseri, TÜRKİYE in 1985.</p>

<p>Actually, I'm a doctor, an Internal Medicine specialist. However, I was not happy with my job as doctors have many
  problem with doing their job safely in Turkey. So, I decided to do something else and thought that the jobs in web
  development, software development might be suitable for me and started to take online courses.</p>

<p>This is my very first project and I'm so glad that I created something and looking forward to do more.</p>

<p>See you soon.</p>
